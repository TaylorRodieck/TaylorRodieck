# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

My name is Taylor Rodieck and I am a developer from The Woodlands, Texas. 
I prefer to work in C# .NET or Python, but I am currently learning Rust to expand my skillset! 
I love to program and learn new things, so I frequently create new repositories for new side projects! 

Below, you can find some highlights from my sideprojects that I have pinned. Thanks for visiting and have a wonderful day!
